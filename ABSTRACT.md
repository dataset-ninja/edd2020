The **EDD2020: Endoscopy Disease Detection and Segmentation** dataset comprises 380 annotated video frames sourced from various international centers, encompassing different gastrointestinal tract organs and endoscopy modalities. The dataset addresses multiple organ categories, such as the colon, esophagus, and stomach, each linked to specific diseases. EDD2020 includes five classes for both detection and segmentation tasks, with a focus on gastrointestinal organs. Patient data has been anonymized and collected with informed consent, while annotations were performed by clinical experts and post-doctoral researchers, accounting for some variability in annotations due to the subjective nature of interpretation.

Endoscopy is crucial for early cancer detection in organs like the esophagus, stomach, colon, and bladder. Accurate localization and segmentation of diseased regions in clinical endoscopy videos are vital for precise diagnosis and surgical planning. Publicly available datasets for disease detection in endoscopy have been historically limited in scope, often concentrating on specific tasks and imaging modalities.

The authors introduce the EDD2020 challenge, which encompasses multi-class, multi-organ, and multi-population disease detection and segmentation in clinical endoscopy. The challenge evaluates disease region localization using bounding boxes and precise pixel-level segmentation, with a strong emphasis on clinical applicability for real-time monitoring and offline performance assessment. Their network of clinical and computational experts collaboratively gathered, curated, and annotated gastrointestinal endoscopy video frames. Released as part of the EDD2020 challenge, this dataset aims to overcome limitations in disease detection and segmentation. The EDD2020 initiative represents a crowd-sourced effort to assess recent deep learning methods and foster robust technology development.

The dataset in question features the following classes: 
1. *BE* (Barrettâ€™s Oesophagus)
2. *suspicious*
3. *HGD* (high-grade dysplasia)
4. *cancer* (adenocarcinoma)
5. *polyp*
