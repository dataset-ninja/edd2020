As stated by the authors of **Endoscopy Disease Detection and segmentation** dataset, endoscopy is vital for early cancer detection in organs like the oesophagus, stomach, and colon. Computer-assisted methods are crucial for precise disease region localization and segmentation in clinical endoscopy videos, improving lesion quantification. However, the lack of well-annotated, representative public datasets for disease detection hampers research. Thus, multi-class disease detection and segmentation challenge aims to fill this gap, offering a comprehensive dataset for algorithm evaluation in disease detection, including spatio-temporal localization and pixel-level segmentation. The dataset covers multiple organs, populations, and diverse endoscopy modalities, focusing on diseases such as polyps, cancer, Barrett's, dysplasia, and more.
