As stated by the authors of **Endoscopy Disease Detection and segmentation** dataset, Endoscopy plays a critical role in early cancer detection in organs like the esophagus, stomach, colon, and bladder. Precise localization and segmentation of diseased regions from clinical endoscopy videos are essential for accurate diagnosis and surgical planning. However, publicly available datasets for disease detection in endoscopy have been limited in scope, often focusing on specific tasks and imaging modalities.

The authors present the EDD2020 challenge, which encompasses multi-class, multi-organ, and multi-population disease detection and segmentation in clinical endoscopy. The challenge evaluates disease region localization through bounding boxes and exact pixel-level segmentation, emphasizing clinical applicability for real-time monitoring and offline performance evaluation. They have leveraged their network of clinical and computational experts to collect, curate, and annotate gastrointestinal endoscopy video frames. This dataset, released as part of the EDD2020 challenge, aims to tackle the limitations in disease detection and segmentation. The EDD2020 initiative is a crowd-sourced effort to test recent deep learning methods and promote robust technology development.

The dataset includes 380 annotated video frames from different gastrointestinal tract organs and various endoscopy modalities, sourced from international centers. The dataset covers multiple organ categories, including colon, esophagus, and stomach, each associated with specific diseases.

The EDD2020 dataset consists of five classes for both detection and segmentation tasks, focusing on gastrointestinal tract organs. Patient data has been anonymized and acquired through informed consent. Annotations were performed by clinical experts and post-doctoral researchers, acknowledging some annotation variability due to the subjective nature of interpretation.
